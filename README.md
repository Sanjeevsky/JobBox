# JobBox

# Introduction

 It's final year project of mine. It is Android Based Project having core idea of Job Portal. In this application user can come as a applicant or employer and could register himself/herself.
 <br>
 If the user is Employer He/She could generate jobs and all the applicant can view these applications and can apply to one job.
 <br>
 IF the user is Applicant than he could register himself/herself and can get all the updates about the newly created job application by various Employers across the work. They can easily monitor their application status through Applied Section.
 <br>
 Both Employer and Applicant could manage their profile and could edit details as per required in time.
